# UnturnedBanFormatter
A simple Ban command formatter for Unturned I threw together in about an hour.
### Note: this is a really low-effort project; I'm just putting it here to share it.

This was originally developed to use on Dark Twilight Gaming, but it will work for any server.

Features:
* Double click input fields to paste
* Double click the output ban command field to copy
* Checkbox list for common ban reasons
* Time formatter to convert a time representation (e.g., "1w", "2days", "1.5h") into seconds
* Notes field and Other-Reason field for cases where reason/note is not listed
* Always-On-Top mode to show the window over other applications, including Unturned
* Settings menu to change your represented name, reason separator, note separator, and always-on-top mode

Ban Reason Format: {reasons} {notes} {Moderator Name/Nickname} {duration}
